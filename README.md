RailsPG
-------

An attempt at creating an RPG in rails.

It`s barely started, so cut it some slack.

* Rails 1.8 onwards
* rubygems

Install
-------

* Clone the git repo from: www.github.com/ajfaraday/railspg
* bundle install
* rake db:initialize
* rake adventure:load_all
* rails s
* open a browser to localhost:3000


To make changes please fork the repo and submit pull requests.

Any code, design and/or feedback is welcome, it is most definitely an open-source project so take part!
